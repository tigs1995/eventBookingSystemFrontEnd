# **Event Booking System - Front End**
### Back end: https://github.com/tigs1995/EventBookingSystem/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Scroll to the bottom for instructions on how to run React apps.

Please view the back end repository to see more information on the architecture and deployment.

## **Testing**
I did not get around to completing Selenium testing for the front-end, however I did start it, which you can view in the 'Selenium-testing'. 

## **How to run**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it

## **Future prospects**

1. Create a colour coded calendar to make it more visible for the user to see which dates are available:

2. Create an automatic estimated quote so the user can accept or deny, which speeds up the process further.

3. Create a log in page so the customers can view their invoices and upcoming events.
